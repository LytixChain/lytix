Lytix Core integration/staging repository
=====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LytixChain/lytix.png)](https://travis-ci.org/LytixChain/lytix) [![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/LytixChain/lytix.svg)](https://github.com/lytixchain/lytix/tree/v1.1.4)

Lytix is an open source crypto-currency focused on fast private transactions with low transaction fees & low confirmations.  It is currently under development and plans are to pull in Bitcoin's improvements for a PIVX clone. I am targeting a mid-December 2018 re-release of the coin.

If the date changes I will notify everyone. Please note that everyone that had a balance during the first release will get an airdrop on re-release plus some extra to cover the trouble and lost time during the first try.

It will be Proof of Stake after a 100,000 block Proof of Work period with masternodes. After 100,000 staked wallets will help support the network.
