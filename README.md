Lytix is an open source crypto-currency focused on fast private transactions with low transaction fees & low confirmations.  It is currently in production. We are in our Proof of Stake phase and development is underway for our Maxnode 3 Tier system.  The goal is to have that live in Testnet in a few months and live in Mainnet by the beginning of Summer 2019.
